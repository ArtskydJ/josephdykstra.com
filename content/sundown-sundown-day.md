[Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:5,8,13,19,23,31)

> <sup>5</sup> God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.  
> <sup>8</sup> And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.  
> <sup>13</sup> So the evening and the morning were the third day.  
> <sup>19</sup> So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  
> <sup>23</sup> So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  
> <sup>31</sup> Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

[Nehemiah 13:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+13%3A19&version=NKJV)

> So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day.

[Psalm 55:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+55%3A17&version=NKJV)

> Evening and morning and at noon  
> I will pray, and cry aloud,  
> And He shall hear my voice.

A Jewish day began at sundown. Does a day still begin at sundown? There are arguments for sundown, midnight and sunrise. I've looked at them all, and have not come to a firm conclusion.

But the time when a day starts/ends is not mandated in the Bible, so we shouldn't be dogmatic in this area. Be consistent in the one you hold to. Don't flip-flop whenever you want to labor on the Sabbath.
