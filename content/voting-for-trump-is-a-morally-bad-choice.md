In the Bible, there are minimal requirements for rulers:

> [2 Samuel 23:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+23%3A3&version=NKJV)  
> He who rules over men must be just, Ruling in the fear of God.

(See longer post by Phillip Kayser about [minimal requirements for rulers](https://www.facebook.com/philkayser/posts/10157270314665311).)

Does Trump fear God?

> [John 14:12,15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A12,15&version=NKJV)  
> "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.
>
> If you love Me, keep My commandments.

Trump does not lead a Godly life, nor does he claim to.  According to God's word, Trump is unfit for office.
