title: Why you should use a feed reader

First post!

You can put this blog on Feedly or another RSS feed reader. Feed Readers are the best things since the interwebs. (OK, maybe not.)

I will probably express feelings on various topics. I hope to post my opinions on Music, Dancing, What Time a Day Begins, and anything else that I feel is worthy. Hopefully I am able to present you with a logical and biblical perspective.

You should check out [Laura's Blog](http://trueandfaithfulwords.wordpress.com/), and [Josh's Blog](http://joshduff.com/).

<!-- TODO add more blog recommendations -->

I might post twice a day, or twice a year, and that is why feed readers are so nice. You add 10 blogs, it gathers the data, you read it on your own schedule, you don't need 10 bookmarks for your 10 favorite blogs.
