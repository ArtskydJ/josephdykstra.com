# Experience


### [T.REX ARMS](https://factsmgt.com/) | 2020 - Present

[I still need to add work experience...]



### [FACTS SIS](https://factsmgt.com/) | 2015 - 2020

<!--
2015-04-06 through 2020-04-24
-->

I am currently working for FACTS SIS on the [SIS](https://factsmgt.com/administration/student-information-system/)(Student Information System) product.  Schools use the SIS for Admissions, Attendance, Communication, Health Info, Gradebooks, Report Cards, Class Scheduling, Staff/Student/Family Info, Transcripts, and more.

I work with a team to fix issues that clients have, and develop new features or new projects for thousands of schools. I ship code regularly, and I enjoy helping my fellow team members.

<div class="avoid-break">

- I created an internal tool to greatly shorten the amount of time it takes to convert customer data from a particular SIS into our SIS. I estimate that this saved over 100 of man-hours of work for the conversion team since its inception two years ago. <!-- 13 schools as of 2020-02-25 -->
- I created a test suite that would batch-scan schools, and would quickly verify that our cloud migration was working as intended. I estimate that without this tool, the same testing would have cost over 50 man-hours of highly repetitive work.
- I have been the primary maintainer of multiple "Integrations", which is a source of recurring income for our company.
	- Many of the integrations use REST APIs to sync school data with 3rd party school-related software, such as Learning Management Systems.
	One such system that I maintain, is a partial [OneRoster API provider](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification) implementation.
- I have created a mailing-label system so schools can print Mail Labels, ID Cards, barcodes, and more onto standard Avery label sheets.
- I track down, and solve a variety of issues. E.g. invalid client data, security issues, optimizing slow database queries, etc.
- I'm the primary maintainer for a system that builds SQL queries for data stored in 50+ tables.  The user selects data fields, filters, and sorting options, and the system exports a spreadsheet of the selected data.

<!--
2009-09-xx Joined FLL, I think
2009-02-09 emailed myself a simple game maker program, "object follow mouse"
2009-01-03 in my journal, I mention discovering game maker
2008-12-24 created my gmail account, so I can't search earlier than that. And all my hotmail emails are gone, so I can't search those either.
2008-12-19 in my journal, I mention NXT.
I thought I did other programming prior to game maker... but I'm not sure, so I'll will stick with 2009.
I had previously written July 2008. Not sure where I got "July 2008". That would have been before JC's wedding.
