### [FACTS SIS](https://factsmgt.com/) | April 2015 - [Present]

<!--
April 6, 2015
-->

I am currently working for FACTS SIS on the [SIS](https://factsmgt.com/administration/student-information-system/) (Student Information System) product.  Schools use the SIS for Admissions, Attendance, Communication, Health Info, Gradebooks, Report Cards, Class Scheduling, Staff/Student/Family Info, Transcripts, and more.

I work with a team to fix issues that clients have, and develop new features or new projects for thousands of schools. I ship code regularly, and I enjoy helping my fellow team members.

- I have created a mailing-label system so schools can print Mail Labels, ID Cards, barcodes, and more onto standard Avery label sheets.
- I have worked with REST APIs to sync school data with 3rd party school-related software, such as Learning Management Systems.
- I fix a variety of issues. E.g. invalid data, security issues, optimizing database queries, etc.
- I'm the primary maintainer for a system that builds SQL queries for data stored in 50+ tables.  The user selects data fields, filters, and sorting options, and the system exports a spreadsheet of the selected data.

This is the only software company that I have worked for.
