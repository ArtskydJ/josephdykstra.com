# About Me

I enjoy software development. I like watching as a project starts from nothing, and progresses into a full-blown application.

I like writing JavaScript modules, and websites.

I am currently working [FACTS](https://factsmgt.com/administration/student-information-system/) on the FACTS SIS product.  Schools use FACTS SIS for Admissions, Attendance, Communication, Health Info, Report Cards, Scheduling, Staff/Student/Family Info, Transcripts, and more.

# Technologies

- JavaScript
	- node.js
	- Electron
- HTML/CSS/JS
- SQL Server
- ColdFusion
- C

### FACTS SIS | April 2015 - [Present]

I work with a team to fix issues that clients have, and develop new features or new projects for over 4000 schools. I ship code regularly, and I enjoy helping my fellow team members.

- I have created a label system so schools can print Mail Labels, ID Cards, barcodes, and more onto standard Avery label sheets.
- I have worked with REST APIs to sync school data with 3rd party school-related software such as Learning Management Systems and State Reporting.
- I work on fixing various issues. My debugging skills have improved a lot in this position.
- I'm the primary maintainer for a system that builds SQL queries for data stored in 50+ tables.  The user selects data fields, filters, and sorting options, and the system will export a spreadsheet of the selected data.

This is the only technology company that I have worked for.

### Personal Projects | July 2008 - [Present]

[Github Repositories](https://github.com/ArtskydJ?tab=repositories) - [NPM modules](http://npmjs.org/~artskydj)

- I wrote [Tab Emitter](https://artskydj.github.io/tab-emitter/), which provides a node.js-like Event Emitter object in the browser to emit events between multiple same-origin tabs
- I wrote [Comics RSS](http://www.comicsrss.com), which serves RSS feeds for over 500 comic strips, which are generated by my automated script that scrapes gocomics.com
- I helped write [Just Login](http://justlogin.xyz/), an email-based authentication library for node.js servers
- I have created hundreds of [pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AArtskydJ+) on Github to various open source projects
- I have written and I maintain over [50 JavaScript modules](http://npmjs.org/~artskydj) for node.js
- I wrote [Snake](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/snake), [Tetris](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/tetris), and an [8-Queens Solver](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/eight-queens) in C
