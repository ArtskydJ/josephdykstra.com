I'm Joseph Dykstra. I like writing code and making bad puns.

Perhaps you know of me from one of the following websites. If you don't, then feel free to check out some of my stuff.

#About Me

##FLL

I was on a [First Lego League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) team, the [Data Dragons](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) for 5 years.

First Lego League (FLL) is a program designed to teach students about science and technology. Each team researchs a problem, creates a solution, and presents it to the judges at a competition. They also create a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and program it to do missions on a 4 ft. x 8 ft. table. Whoever scores the most points gets an award, whoever has the best presentation gets an award, etc.

###What I learned

I learned about basic robotics, mechanics, teamwork, and a little bit of programming.

##VEX

I was on the [VEX](http://vexrobotics.org) team: [TechnaPWN](http://technapwn.com) for 2 years.

VEX was designed to teach students about STEM. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.) Students design, build, program, and drive a robot for each game, documenting their progress.

2013 was my first year, and I basically helped build the robot. I did some code maintainence, and some autonomous programming. [TechnaPWN Programming Skills 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmyI8DoeQE)

2014 was my last year. (As a student, that is. I do a bit of mentoring now.) I took a larger role in all areas; I designed and built more of the robot than I did the previous year, and I was the sole programmer. I was also the main driver, but could not have gone far without the coach and secondary driver. (Shout-out to y'all!) At the World Championship, we had issues, but were picked by [Team 1200F](http://youtu.be/QR0cl95RWIQ). We ended up losing in the Division Finals, in matches 2 and 3. Here is my favorite match: [Division Finals Match 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQccSPfuhW4)

###What I learned

I learned about intermediate robotics, mechanics, and programming. It was also a good tool for learning to handle stress. :)
