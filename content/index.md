#About Me

##FLL

I was on the [First Lego League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) team: [Data Dragons](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) for 5 years.

First Lego League (FLL) is a program designed to teach students about science and technology. Each team researchs a problem, creates a solution, and presents it to the judges at a competition. They also create a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and program it to do missions on a 4 ft. x 8 ft. table. Whoever scores the most points gets an award, whoever has the best presentation gets an award, etc.

###What I learned

I learned about basic robotics, mechanics, teamwork, and a little bit of programming.

###Team Acheivements



##VEX

I was on the [VEX](http://vexrobotics.org) team: [TechnaPWN](http://technapwn.com) for 2 years.

VEX was designed to teach students about STEM. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.) Students design, build, program, and drive a robot for each game, documenting their progress.

2013 was my first year, and I basically helped build the robot. I did some code maintainence, and some autonomous programming. [TechnaPWN Programming Skills 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmyI8DoeQE)

2014 was my last year. (As a student, that is. I do a bit of mentoring now.) I took a larger role in all areas; I designed and built more of the robot than I did the previous year, and I was the sole programmer. I was also the main driver, but could not have gone far without the coach and secondary driver. (Shout-out to y'all!) At the World Championship, we had issues, but were picked by [Team 1200F](http://youtu.be/QR0cl95RWIQ). We ended up losing in the Division Finals, in matches 2 and 3. Here is my favorite match: [Division Finals Match 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQccSPfuhW4)
