I'm Joseph Dykstra. I like writing code and making silly puns.

I'm known as ArtskydJ many places around the internet. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JosephDykstra), [GitHub](https://github.com/ArtskydJ), [npm](https://npmjs.com/~artskydj), and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/YoungerDykstras).

I helped [TehShrike](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) create [Just Login](http://justlogin.xyz), an open source password-less authentication library for node.js.

I also created [lmnpmtfy](http://lmnpmtfy.com). It is like [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com), but for [npm](https://npmjs.com).

I have contributed to [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), which is like ui-router, but without all the Angular. [View the demo!](http://tehshrike.github.io/state-router-example)
