### Writing code

I currently work for [T.REX ARMS](https://www.trex-arms.com/) which is an e-commerce retailer specializing in firearm- and defense-related products.  I mostly work on internal software, but I helped with parts of the customer-facing site, including the [holster configurator](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/trex-arms-sidecar-holster/).

I created [Comics RSS](https://www.comicsrss.com/), which scrapes webpages to create RSS feeds for the comic strips.

I worked for [FACTS SIS](https://factsmgt.com/student-information/student-information-system/).  I don't have any public-facing code, but here's a [tutorial](https://www.iorad.com/player/1705220/How-to-Create-Custom-Reports-in-FACTS#trysteps-7) of "Create a Report", which I helped maintain.  Because my team maintained legacy Adobe ColdFusion code, I wrote a couple tools for ColdFusion, including a [REPL](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/coldfusion-repl).

I contributed to [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), which is like Angular's ui-router, but without all the Angular.
