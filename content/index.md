I'm Joseph Dykstra. I live near Omaha, Nebraska.

I enjoy coffee, microeconomics, theology, writing code, board games, personal finance, Rocket League, volleyball, comics, robotics, Rubik's cubes, and open source software. I'm known as ArtskydJ many places around the internet. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JosephDykstra), [GitHub](https://github.com/ArtskydJ), and [npm](https://npmjs.com/~artskydj).

### Writing code

I created [Comics RSS](https://www.comicsrss.com/), which scrapes webpages to create RSS feeds for the comic strips.

I helped [TehShrike](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) create [Just Login](http://justlogin.xyz), a password-less authentication library for node.js.  I also contributed to [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), which is like Angular's ui-router, but without all the Angular.
