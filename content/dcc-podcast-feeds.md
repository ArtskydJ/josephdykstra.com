[My church](http://www.dominioncovenantchurch.com) has an RSS feed, and I want to listen through sermon series with my [podcast app](./android-podcast-apps-review). There are a few problems with this:

- The RSS feed has thousands of entries. This makes it tough to find and download a series.
- The RSS feed has sermons and communion meditations (mini-sermons) all mixed together.
- The RSS feed has some unrelated sermons in the middle of a series.

I was going to make a scraper that would look up the sermons in a series, and create an RSS file, but I found that my church's website will dynamically generate an RSS feed for a series. There is not a way to open a series' RSS feed using the church's website.

Now the problem is that it's not very easy to get a link to a series' RSS feed... Until now!
