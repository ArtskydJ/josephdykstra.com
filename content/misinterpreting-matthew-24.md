Matthew 24:1-34

> Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down."

> Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"

> And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.

> Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

> Therefore when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place" (whoever reads, let him understand), "then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened.

> Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand.

> Therefore if they say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.

> Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

> Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is nearâ€”at the doors! Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.

If you are unaware of how many Christians see this passage, try reading this: [5 signs that Jesus is going to return soon](http://heavenscity.com/2016/04/05/5-signs-that-jesus-is-going-to-return-soon/), and maybe the comment section as well (if you're into that sort of thing).

The Great Tribulation has already happened. You can read about the [Siege of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(AD_70)). If you hear wars an rumors of wars today, it doesn't mean Jesus is coming back soon, since this prophecy has already been fulfilled.

The Son of Man sent His angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. This can not be in the future, since Jesus says very plainly that all these things will occur in some of the listeners' lifetimes. (See verse 34.)

After talking about the Siege of Jerusalem, Jesus went on to talk about the end of the age. There are multiple interpretations, and my mind has been changed on what the following refers to. It is easy to assume that "End of the age" means "end of the world". I don't believe that anymore.

Jesus said Heaven and earth will pass away, but His words will not. He is emphasizing how certain His words are. The Great Tribulation is not the same as Heaven and earth passing away. If it was, then you would be forced to believe (with verses 34-35) that Heaven and earth passed away within a generation of Christ's human walk on the earth. (Maybe there's some argument that earth as they knew it passed away? That feels like a stretch. But Heaven didn't pass away.)

> But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."

All that has passed.

<p>
apparently, the following argument made a lot of sense to a younger me.
it is embarassing

Here, Jesus explains that we *will not* have signs telling us when the end times are coming. If the Great Tribulation is the End Times, then this makes no sense, becuase Jesus Himself just told them signs for the Great Tribulation.

I do not believe great trib is the end times
I do believe that great trib was the end of the age
I do not believe and that end of the age is the end times.

The things that Jesus describes here are not signs of a future trib. They are effects of an in-progress tribulation.

And the one taken, and the other is left, is a bit awkward if you believe in an optimistic eschatology, as I do.
