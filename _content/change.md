For the most part, people detest equal change. What I mean by equal change is a change that doesn't hurt you or benefit you.

When I first heard we were moving down to Omaha, I didn't like the idea. Now, I am so glad we did, I can't imagine if we would have stayed.

I think that the main reason people want change when they do want it, is because they want to undo a change that happened previously, or want something better. People nostalgically want to live back in the "Glory Days".

**News Flash:** Things don't go back to exactly the way they were.

Even when the millennium comes, (assuming you believe in post-millennial-ism,) things won't go back to the way they were before the fall. There'll still be sin.
