I wrote a speech/poem/rap for my brother's wedding. The lyrics are as follows:

-----

Mi**chael** and Eli**za**beth, the new**ly** married cou**ple**,  
I'm **ex**cited for **you** both, yet it's **sad** to see you **go**.  
It **has** been really **awe**some having **Mi**chael as my **bro**,  
Here **are** some facts a**bout** him that you **may** or may not **know**:

-----

Mi**chael** is very **car**ing, and for **that** he is a**dored**,  
He's **grac**ious, and he's **thought**ful, and he **seeks** to please the **Lord**.  
Our re**la**tionship was**n't** a picture **per**fect story**board**,  
But o**ver** a little **time** it has most **def**initely **soared**.

"To **have** a good re**lation**ship with your **wife**, you must be **nice**  
to **your** mom and your **sis**ters" our dad **told** us Dykstra **guys**.  
I've **ob**served that Mi**chael** has indeed **foll**owed that ad**vice**;  
He **hugs** Becky or **mom** of-ten; like **each** day, if not **twice**.

-----

Mi**chael** is a ge**ner**ous guy; he'd **of**ten volun**teer**,  
a**round** the house, at **church**, and es-sen**tial**ly any**where**.  
He'll **stop** by the road, **to** help a stran**ger** put on a **spare**.  
Him **loan**ing out his **re**sources is **a** common af**fair**.

**If** the milk ran **out**, and mom said "**Who** wants to get **more**?"  
Of**ten** Michael would **cheer**fully go **car**ry out the **chore**.  
His **sib**lings' food was **some**thing he would **ran**domly pay **for**.  
He **was** the kind of **guy** who would o**pen** and hold the **door**.

-----

If **you** know Michael **at** all, then you **know** he's dili**gent**,  
and **that** he likes to **make** sure that all **his** time is well **spent**.  
After **a** short obser**va**tion, a stran**ger** made the com**ment**  
that **he** wished he could **have** Michael un**der** his employ**ment**.

He **stu**dies for his **school**, early be**fore** the sky is **lit**.  
He **works** quickly when **on** the job and **he's** not counter**feit**.  
I **know** this because **at** home he does **not** just like to **sit**.  
He **sees** work that needs **to** be done, and **pro**ceeds to do **it**.

-----

So **as** you both ac**com**plish this mi**le**stone of life's **race**,  
it **is** my prayer that **God** will give you **His** amazing **grace**.  
Un**til** the day you **pass** away, and **stand** before God's **face**;  
put **God** first, then your **spouse** second, and **your**self in third **place**.
