There are three different areas that you have to consider when analyzing if something is right or wrong. I will expound on them later.

1. Law
2. Motive
3. Situation

First is law:
The 1st commandment is 'You shall have no other gods before me.' This is a great example of law, there are no exceptions in this commandment. If you have a god before God, then you're sinning.

Second is Motive, Third is Situation

Executing a good deed for the wrong motive, or in the wrong situation can be sin.

There is a fiction book that we have where a boy is supposed to learn Mozart's 'Moonlight Sonata'. His mom tells him to practice until the newly-lit candles burn down. After she leaves to go to the store, he opens a window so that the candles burn down faster. His motive was to evade the spirit of the law, thus opening the window was, in my opinion, wrong. (If it was real. I remember that it's fiction.) If it was any other night, opening the window would have been fine, but in this situation, (and with the knowledge the boy presumably had) this is inexcusable dodging of the rule.
