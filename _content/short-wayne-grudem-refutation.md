I was going to read [a refutation](http://www.thegreatfiction.com/2016/07/30/the-moral-case-for-donald-trump-refuted/) to Wayne Grudem's article about voting for Trump, but then I saw the dreaded "wall of text". The small scrollbar whispered, "Is this really how you want to spend your time?"  And so instead of reading a few paragraphs, I decided to see if I can construct a shorter refutation.

In Wayne Grudem's article, *[Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice](http://townhall.com/columnists/waynegrudem/2016/07/28/why-voting-for-donald-trump-is-a-morally-good-choice-n2199564)*, under the *A good candidate with flaws* section, he states:

> I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a *flawed* candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.

In the Bible, there are minimal requirements for rulers:

> [2 Samuel 23:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+23%3A3&version=NKJV)  
> He who rules over men must be just, Ruling in the fear of God.

(See longer post by Phillip Kayser about [minimal requirements for rulers](https://www.facebook.com/philkayser/posts/10157270314665311).)

Does Trump fear God? I believe the answer is a definite "no".

> [John 14:12,15]()  
> "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.
>
> If you love Me, keep My commandments.

Trump does not lead a Godly life, nor does he claim to. Trump is unfit for office, according to God's word.
