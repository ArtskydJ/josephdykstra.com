I like writing JavaScript modules, and websites.

I am currently working remotely for [RenWeb](http://renweb.com), a company that makes school-related software.  I fix issues that clients have, create custom reports, and develop new functionality.

# Experience

### RenWeb | April 2015 - [Present]

[renweb.com](http://renweb.com)

I work with a small team to fix issues that come in, and develop new features on software for over 3000 schools.

- I have created a label system so schools can print Mail Labels, ID Cards, barcodes, and more onto standard Avery label sheets.
- I have worked with REST APIs to sync school data with 3rd party school-related software such as LMS's and State Reporting.
- I work on fixing various issues. Few issues are like other issues. My debugging skills have improved a lot in this position.

### Personal Projects | July 2008 - [Present]

[Github Repositories](https://github.com/ArtskydJ?tab=repositories) - [NPM modules](http://npmjs.org/~artskydj)

- I helped write [Abstract State Router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), which is a client side router, like ui-router, but without all the Angular.
- I helped write [Just Login](http://justlogin.xyz/), an email-based authentication library for node.js servers
- I have created hundreds of [pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AArtskydJ+) on Github to various open source projects
- I wrote the [generator code](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/josephdykstra.com) for my [website](http://josephdykstra.com/)
- I have written and I maintain over [50 JavaScript modules](http://npmjs.org/~artskydj) for node.js
- I wrote [Snake](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/snake), [Tetris](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/tetris), and an [8-Queens Solver](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/eight-queens) in C

### Well Rooted Gardens | May 2014 - April 2015

<!--

I worked part time for Well Rooted Gardens doing landscaping, and during the winter, we did snow removal.

### Coding in the Wild | October 2013 - August 2016

<!--
October 2, 2013 - August 11, 2016
-->

[github.com/coding-in-the-wild](http://github.com/coding-in-the-wild)

Coding in the Wild was a group started by a professional developer.  He invited people who were interested in software development to learn development techniques.  We worked together to create a back-end node.js authentication module with an [interactive website](http://justlogin.xyz/).  We created [Abstract State Router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), which is like Angular's UI Router, but not tied to Angular.  We also worked to create a chat room where users upload & play their music for the group, in a round-robin fashion.

### TechnaPWN (VEX Robotics) | September 2012 - April 2015

[technapwn.com](http://technapwn.com) - [youtube.com/TechnaPWN](http://youtube.com/TechnaPWN)

I wrote RobotC [code](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/technapwn-toss-up) (based on C) for a VEX robot, including pre-programmed routines, teleoperation, slewed motor control, an extensive LCD menu system, and more.  I maintained and updated the code throughout the entire season.  Also, the previous year, I worked with two other team members to write and maintain the code-base.  In April of 2014, I was too old to stay the team, but mentored them for a year.

### Data Dragons (FLL, LEGO Robotics) | September 2008 - February 2013

[datadragonsfll.com](http://datadragonsfll.com)

Being on this team taught me about teamwork and basic robotics.  The team took 1st place Robot Performance at Nebraska State in 2012.  I was a mentor for the team during the 2012-2013 season.
