> **Psalm 1** (Italicized words are not part of the text; they are notes.)
> <br> *Righteous* <sub>1</sub> Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;
> <br> *Righteous* <sub>2</sub> But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night.
> <br> *Righteous* <sub>3</sub> He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.
> <br> *Wicked* <sub>4</sub> The ungodly are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
> <br> *Wicked* <sub>5</sub> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
> <br> *Both* <sub>6</sub> For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

Verse 6 is about both.

I think that Psalm 1 is like a [Hebrew Chiasm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus#In_Scripture), (ki-as-um). A chiasm is when you go through a list of things and then again in reverse order. [The beatitudes](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205-6:24&amp;version=NKJV) are a great example...

Verses 1-2 are opposite of Verse 5.  
Verse 3 is the opposite of Verse 4.  
Verse 6 is the conclusion.
