This is the main code repository for the wiki-friendly blog-capable cms that I wrote.

Check out [noddity.com](http://noddity.com/) for more details on the cms, the project in general, and easy installation instructions.

If you want your own copy of Noddity running on Github Pages (imagine it, a Github-backed wiki!) just fork the [gh-pages](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repository.

If you're using Noddity as a wiki, bear in mind that the client caches all content, so while new visitors will see your changes as soon as you make them, it will take a while for them to show up in your browser.

If you have any questions at all, or any comments, email <me@JoshDuff.com> or hit up [TehShrike](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) on Twitter.
