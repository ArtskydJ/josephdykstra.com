title: VEX
date: 2014-11-18

I was on a [VEX](http://vexrobotics.org) team, [TechnaPWN Robotics](http://technapwn.com) for 2 years.

VEX was designed to teach students about STEM. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.) Students design, build, program, and drive a robot for each game, documenting their progress.

2013 was my first year, and I basically helped build the robot. I did some code maintainence, and some autonomous programming. [TechnaPWN Programming Skills 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmyI8DoeQE)

2014 was my last year. (As a student, that is. I do a bit of mentoring now.) I took a larger role in all areas; I designed and built more of the robot than I did the previous year, and I was the sole programmer. I was also the main driver, but could not have gone far without the coach and secondary driver. (Shout-out to y'all!) At the World Championship, we had issues, but were picked by [Team 1200F](http://youtu.be/QR0cl95RWIQ). We ended up losing in the Division Finals, in matches 2 and 3. Here is my favorite match: [Division Finals Match 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQccSPfuhW4)

###What I learned

I learned about intermediate robotics, mechanics, and programming. It was also a good tool for learning to handle stress. :)
