# About Me

I am passionate about software development. I am ambitious, and have been learning software development for over 5 years.

One of my projects was to write code for robots, and I was exposed to regular deadlines.  I designed and implemented a powerful autonomous framework, which allowed me to write many reliable routines for the robot.

Recently, I have been sharpening my skills and knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I've been writing interactive websites, and JavaScript modules for the server.

Coding in the Wild is a group started by a professional developer.  He invited people who were interested in software development to learn development techniques.  We worked together to create a back-end node.js authentication module with an [interactive website](http://justlogin.xyz/).  Now we are working to create a chat room where users upload & play their music for the group, in a round-robin fashion.

[technapwn.wix.com/3018](http://technapwn.wix.com/3018) - [youtube.com/TechnaPWN](http://youtube.com/TechnaPWN)

I wrote RobotC [code](https://github.com/ArtskydJ/technapwn-toss-up) (based on C) for a VEX robot, including pre-programmed routines, teleoperation, slewed motor control, an extensive LCD menu system, and more.  I maintained and updated the code throughout the entire season.  Also, the previous year, I worked with two other team members to write and maintain the code-base.  I am now mentoring the team, although I am not on it.

### Data Dragons (FLL, LEGO Robotics) | September 2008 - February 2013

Being on this team taught me about teamwork and basic robotics.  The team took 1st place Robot Performance at Nebraska State in 2012.  I was a mentor for the team during the 2012-2013 season.
