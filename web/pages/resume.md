Coding in the Wild is a group started by a professional developer.  He invited people who were interested in software development to learn development techniques.  We worked together to create a back-end node.js authentication module with an [interactive website](http://justlogin.xyz/).  Now we are working to create a chat room where users upload & play their music for the group, in a round-robin fashion.

I wrote RobotC code (based on C) for a VEX robot, including pre-programmed routines, teleoperation, slewed motor control, an extensive LCD menu system, and more.  I maintained and updated the code throughout the entire season.  Also, the previous year, I worked with two other students to write and maintain the codebase.  I am now mentoring the team, although I am not on it.

###Data Dragons (FLL, LEGO Robotics) | September 2008 - February 2013

Being on this team taught me about teamwork and basic robotics.  The team took 1st place Robot Performance at Nebraska State in 2012.  I was a mentor for the team during the 2012-2013 season.
