Schools use the SIS for Admissions, Attendance, Communication, Health Info, Gradebooks, Report Cards, Class Scheduling, Staff/Student/Family Info, Transcripts, and more.</p> <p>I work with a team to fix issues that clients have, and develop new features or new projects for thousands of schools. I ship code regularly, and I enjoy helping my fellow team members.</p></div> <div class="avoid-break"><ul><li>I created an internal tool to greatly shorten the amount of time it takes to convert customer data from a particular SIS into our SIS. I estimate that this saved over 100 of man-hours of work for the conversion team since its inception two years ago.</li> <li>I created a test suite that would batch-scan schools, and would quickly verify that our cloud migration was working as intended. I estimate that without this tool, the same testing would have cost over 50 man-hours of highly repetitive work.</li> <li>I have been the primary maintainer of multiple "Integrations", which is a source of recurring income for our company. <ul><li>Many of the integrations use REST APIs to sync school data with 3rd party school-related software, such as Learning Management Systems. One such system that I maintain, is a partial <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification">OneRoster API provider</a> implementation.</li></ul></li> <li>I have created a mailing-label system so schools can print Mail Labels, ID Cards, barcodes, and more onto standard Avery label sheets.</li> <li>I track down, and solve a variety of issues. E.g. invalid client data, security issues, optimizing slow database queries, etc.</li> <li>I'm the primary maintainer for a system that builds SQL queries for data stored in 50+ tables. The user selects data fields, filters, and sorting options, and the system exports a spreadsheet of the selected data.</li></ul></div> <div class="avoid-break"><h3 id="personal-projects-2009-present">Personal Projects | 2009 - Present</h3> <p><a href="https://github.com/ArtskydJ?tab=repositories">Github Repositories</a> - <a href="http://npmjs.org/~artskydj">NPM modules</a></p> <ul><li>I wrote <a href="https://artskydj.github.io/tab-emitter/">Tab Emitter</a>, which provides a node.js-like Event Emitter object in the browser to emit events between multiple same-origin tabs</li> <li>I wrote <a href="https://www.comicsrss.com">Comics RSS</a>, which serves RSS feeds for over 500 comic strips, which are generated by my automated script that scrapes gocomics.com</li> <li>I helped write <a href="http://justlogin.xyz/">Just Login</a>, an email-based authentication library for node.js servers</li> <li>I have created hundreds of <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3AArtskydJ+">pull requests</a> on Github to various open source projects</li> <li>I have written and I maintain over <a href="https://npmjs.org/~artskydj">50 JavaScript modules</a> for node.js</li> <li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ArtskydJ/snake">Snake</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ArtskydJ/tetris">Tetris</a>, and an <a href="https://github.com/ArtskydJ/eight-queens">8-Queens Solver</a> in C</li></ul></div> <div class="avoid-break"><h1 id="references">References</h1> <ul><li>Josh Duff <ul><li><a href="https://joshduff.com">https://joshduff.com</a></li> <li>Developer</li></ul></li> <li>Tobias Davis <ul><li><a href="https://davistobias.com">https://davistobias.com</a></li> <li>Developer</li></ul></li> <li>Seth Dykstra (Family) <ul><li>IT Support, <a href="https://gonines.com/">Five Nines</a></li></ul></li> <li>David Dykstra (Family) <ul><li>Owner of Millennium Construction (Omaha)</li></ul></li> <li>Michael Dykstra (Family) <ul><li>Apprentice plumber, Schulte Plumbing</li></ul></li></ul></div>
