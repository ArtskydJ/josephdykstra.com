            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a fan of podcasts, and I recently purchased an android phone. I needed an app to handle podcasts for me. I have a few requirements for a podcast app:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want the app to automatically download the episodes from oldest to newest</li>
<li>I want the app to delete the listened episodes</li>
<li>I want the UI to be simple, and intuitive</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried 4 well-rated apps: AntennaPod, Podcast Republic, Podkicker, and Podcast Addict</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: Facts such as ratings and features of apps might change after I write this review.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>AntennaPod</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod">AntennaPod</a> is rated 4.5 stars on the google play store. It is ad-free and open source.</p>
<p>The UI is great. It is simple, intuitive, and I like how it is set up.</p>
<p>It does have an auto-download, and auto-delete. However, it doesn't support downloading from oldest to newest, so it's out.</p>
<h2>Podcast Republic</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app&amp;hl=en">Podcast Republic</a> is rated 4.4 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>The UI is beautiful. The app feel like it was created by a designer; it acts in non-android-standard ways. This makes it less intuitive, but allows the app to be cleaner. This app is a bit confusing with the many screens it has.</p>
<p>Lots of settings for this app, but they're well organized, so you can easily find the setting you're looking for.</p>
<p>This app has auto-download and auto-delete. It's unable to auto-download oldest to newest, so I am not keeping it.</p>
<h2>Podkicker</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ait.podka">Podkicker</a> is rated 4.2 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>This app is hands-down the simplest UI for a podcast app of the four. Very intuitive, and easy to use, but the simplicity has its downsides, including making it harder to do some bulk tasks, but this was rather minor.</p>
<p>The app seems to lack an auto-delete, but it has a new-episodes-only auto-download. Goodbye app.</p>
<h2>Podcast Addict</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict">Podcast Addict</a> is rated 4.6 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>This podcast player has a bunch of features that I don't (and probably will never) use, such as playlists, and live streams. There are <em>a lot</em> of settings, but they start with pretty good defaults, so it's not an issue.</p>
<p>This was the only app I could find that would download from oldest to newest. I've set a limit of 10 auto-downloaded episodes per show, so I don't fill up my phone right away.</p>
<p>The UI is pretty good, and not too hard to figure out as you go. It also has silence skipping, which is sort of neat.</p>
<p>I'm really liking this app, and I got the <strong>Donate</strong> version. If you like the app, it's worth supporting the developer (and removing ads) by throwing a few bucks his way.</p>
<h2>You're so picky!</h2>
<p>Maybe you're saying, "one silly feature destroyed most of your options!"</p>
<p>I don't want to have to think about my podcast app. If I have to think about it, or manually download episodes before driving, then it's not doing it's job as well as it should.</p>
<h2>Bye</h2>
<p>I hope this helps you decide on a podcast app. Thanks for reading!</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a speech/poem/rap for my brother's wedding. The lyrics are as follows:</p>
<hr>
<p>Mi<strong>chael</strong> and Eli<strong>za</strong>beth, the new<strong>ly</strong> married cou<strong>ple</strong>,<br>
I'm <strong>ex</strong>cited for <strong>you</strong> both, yet it's <strong>sad</strong> to see you <strong>go</strong>.<br>
It <strong>has</strong> been really <strong>awe</strong>some having <strong>Mi</strong>chael as my <strong>bro</strong>,<br>
Here <strong>are</strong> some facts a<strong>bout</strong> him that you <strong>may</strong> or may not <strong>know</strong>:</p>
<hr>
<p>Mi<strong>chael</strong> is very <strong>car</strong>ing, and for <strong>that</strong> he is a<strong>dored</strong>,<br>
He's <strong>grac</strong>ious, and he's <strong>thought</strong>ful, and he <strong>seeks</strong> to please the <strong>Lord</strong>.<br>
Our re<strong>la</strong>tionship was<strong>n't</strong> a picture <strong>per</strong>fect story<strong>board</strong>,<br>
But o<strong>ver</strong> a little <strong>time</strong> it has most <strong>def</strong>initely <strong>soared</strong>.</p>
<p>"To <strong>have</strong> a good re<strong>lation</strong>ship with your <strong>wife</strong>, you must be <strong>nice</strong><br>
to <strong>your</strong> mom and your <strong>sis</strong>ters" our dad <strong>told</strong> us Dykstra <strong>guys</strong>.<br>
I've <strong>ob</strong>served that Mi<strong>chael</strong> has indeed <strong>foll</strong>owed that ad<strong>vice</strong>;<br>
He <strong>hugs</strong> Becky or <strong>mom</strong> of-ten; like <strong>each</strong> day, if not <strong>twice</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mi<strong>chael</strong> is a ge<strong>ner</strong>ous guy; he'd <strong>of</strong>ten volun<strong>teer</strong>,<br>
a<strong>round</strong> the house, at <strong>church</strong>, and es-sen<strong>tial</strong>ly any<strong>where</strong>.<br>
He'll <strong>stop</strong> by the road, <strong>to</strong> help a stran<strong>ger</strong> put on a <strong>spare</strong>.<br>
Him <strong>loan</strong>ing out his <strong>re</strong>sources is <strong>a</strong> common af<strong>fair</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> the milk ran <strong>out</strong>, and mom said "<strong>Who</strong> wants to get <strong>more</strong>?"<br>
Of<strong>ten</strong> Michael would <strong>cheer</strong>fully go <strong>car</strong>ry out the <strong>chore</strong>.<br>
His <strong>sib</strong>lings' food was <strong>some</strong>thing he would <strong>ran</strong>domly pay <strong>for</strong>.<br>
He <strong>was</strong> the kind of <strong>guy</strong> who would o<strong>pen</strong> and hold the <strong>door</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> know Michael <strong>at</strong> all, then you <strong>know</strong> he's dili<strong>gent</strong>,<br>
and <strong>that</strong> he likes to <strong>make</strong> sure that all <strong>his</strong> time is well <strong>spent</strong>.<br>
After <strong>a</strong> short obser<strong>va</strong>tion, a stran<strong>ger</strong> made the com<strong>ment</strong><br>
that <strong>he</strong> wished he could <strong>have</strong> Michael un<strong>der</strong> his employ<strong>ment</strong>.</p>
<p>He <strong>stu</strong>dies for his <strong>school</strong>, early be<strong>fore</strong> the sky is <strong>lit</strong>.<br>
He <strong>works</strong> quickly when <strong>on</strong> the job and <strong>he's</strong> not counter<strong>feit</strong>.<br>
I <strong>know</strong> this because <strong>at</strong> home he does <strong>not</strong> just like to <strong>sit</strong>.<br>
He <strong>sees</strong> work that needs <strong>to</strong> be done, and <strong>pro</strong>ceeds to do <strong>it</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>So <strong>as</strong> you both ac<strong>com</strong>plish this mi<strong>le</strong>stone of life's <strong>race</strong>,<br>
it <strong>is</strong> my prayer that <strong>God</strong> will give you <strong>His</strong> amazing <strong>grace</strong>.<br>
Un<strong>til</strong> the day you <strong>pass</strong> away, and <strong>stand</strong> before God's <strong>face</strong>;<br>
put <strong>God</strong> first, then your <strong>spouse</strong> second, and <strong>your</strong>self in third <strong>place</strong>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was on a <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">First Lego League</a> team, the <a href="http://datadragons.com/">Data Dragons</a> for 5 years.</p>
<p>First Lego League (FLL) is a program designed to teach students about science and technology. Each team researchs a problem, creates a solution, and presents it to the judges at a competition. They also create a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and program it to do missions on a 4 ft. x 8 ft. table. Whoever scores the most points gets an award, whoever has the best presentation gets an award, etc.</p>
<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>I learned about basic robotics, mechanics, teamwork, and a little bit of programming.</p>
<h3>Team Acheivements (While I was on the team)</h3>
<ul>
<li>2008: Climate Connections

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was on a <a href="http://vexrobotics.org">VEX</a> team, <a href="http://technapwn.com">TechnaPWN Robotics</a> for 2 years.</p>
<p>VEX was designed to teach students about STEM. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.) Students design, build, program, and drive a robot for each game, documenting their progress.</p>
<p>2013 was my first year, and I basically helped build the robot. I did some code maintainence, and some autonomous programming. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUmyI8DoeQE">TechnaPWN Programming Skills 2013</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TUmyI8DoeQE"></iframe>
<p>2014 was my last year. (As a student, that is. I do a bit of mentoring now.) I took a larger role in all areas; I designed and built more of the robot than I did the previous year, and I was the sole programmer. I was also the main driver, but could not have gone far without the coach and secondary driver. (Shout-out to y'all!) At the World Championship, we had issues, but were picked by <a href="http://youtu.be/QR0cl95RWIQ">Team 1200F</a>. We ended up losing in the Division Finals, in matches 2 and 3. Here is my favorite match: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQccSPfuhW4">Division Finals Match 1</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YQccSPfuhW4"></iframe>
<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>I learned about intermediate robotics, mechanics, and programming. It was also a good tool for learning to handle stress. :)</p>
<h3>Team Acheivements (While I was on the team)</h3>
<ul>
<li>2013: Sack Attack
<ul>
<li>Regionals: Tournament Champions at 5 of 7; various other awards</li>
<li>Nationals: 2nd Place Programming Skills, Division Finalists</li>
<li>Worlds: Innovate Award, 2nd Place Programming Skills</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2014: Toss Up
<ul>
<li>Regionals: various awards</li>
<li>Iowa State: 9-0-0, 1st Seed, Tournament Champions, Excellence Award</li>
<li>Nationals: 8-2-0, 2nd Seed</li>

<p>I work part time for Well Rooted Gardens doing landscape work.  During the winter, we do snow removal.</p>
<h3>Coding in the Wild | October 2, 2013 - [Present]</h3>
<p><a href="http://github.com/coding-in-the-wild">github.com/coding-in-the-wild</a></p>
<p>Coding in the Wild is a group started by a professional developer.  He invited people who were interested in software development to learn development techniques.  We worked together to create a back-end node.js authentication module with an <a href="http://justlogin.xyz/">interactive website</a>.  Now we are working to create a chat room where users upload &amp; play their music for the group, in a round-robin fashion.</p>
<h3>TechnaPWN (VEX Robotics) | September 2012 - April 2014</h3>
<p><a href="http://technapwn.com">technapwn.com</a> - <a href="http://youtube.com/TechnaPWN">youtube.com/TechnaPWN</a></p>

I maintained and updated the code throughout the entire season.  Also, the previous year, I worked with two other team members to write and maintain the code-base.  I am now mentoring the team, although I am not on it.</p>
<h3>Data Dragons (FLL, LEGO Robotics) | September 2008 - February 2013</h3>
<p><a href="http://datadragonsfll.com">datadragonsfll.com</a></p>
